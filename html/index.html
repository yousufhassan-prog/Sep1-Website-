        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>Cloverville is a small eco-village where 42 residents work together
         to live more sustainably. We grow food, share tools, and reduce waste
         wherever we can. To make our everyday green efforts visible, Green Bob
         created a simple system that tracks our sustainable actions, communal 
         tasks, and small point-based trades. The website shares our ideas and 
         shows how small actions add up to real community impact.</p>

                <p>Cloverville residents often choose the bicycle instead of a car
                 and record it as a green action. Cycling to work for a whole week
                 is one of the most common examples. It is registered anonymously in
                 the system, adds green points to the shared “climate capital”, and
                 appears in the catalogue of ideas so others can see what is possible
                 without it turning into a competition.</p>

                <p>Another typical green action in Cloverville is eating vegan for a week,
                 often using vegetables grown in the village. Leftovers and peels are 
                 composted and later returned to the shared gardens as nutrient-rich soil.
                Like all green actions, this is registered with green points and shown 
                anonymously to inspire others to try similar changes in their everyday life.</p>
