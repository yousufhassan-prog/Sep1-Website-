        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>
          Cloverville is a small eco village where 42 residents work together to
          live more sustainably. We grow food, share tools and reduce waste
          wherever we can. To make our everyday green efforts visible, Green Bob
          created a simple system that tracks our sustainable actions, communal
          tasks and small point based trades. The website shares our ideas and
          shows how small actions add up to real community impact.

            <p>
              Cloverville residents often choose the bicycle instead of a car
              and record it as a green action. Cycling to work for a whole week
              is one of the most common examples. It is registered anonymously
              in the system, adds green points to the shared climate capital and
              appears in the catalogue of ideas so others can see what is
              possible without it turning into a competition.

              Another typical green action in Cloverville is eating vegan for a
              week, often using vegetables grown in the village. Leftovers and
              peels are composted and later returned to the shared gardens as
              nutrient rich soil. Like all green actions, this is registered
              with green points and shown anonymously to inspire others to try
              similar changes in their everyday life.
